  ## Project Overview

Customer churn refers to the phenomenon where customers stop using a companyâ€™s services within a specific period. For subscription-based businesses like telecom providers, understanding and predicting churn is critical, as retaining existing customers is generally more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. The project utilizes SQL for data handling, Python for data processing and modeling and Power BI to create an interactive dashboard that visualizes key insights and trends related to churn.
  
## Dataset

The Customer Churn dataset contains information on all 7,043 customers from a Telecommunications company in California. Each record represents one customer and contains details about their demographics, location, tenure, contract types, subscription services, customer status etc. Churn label is the target.
