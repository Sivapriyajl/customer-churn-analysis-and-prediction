  ## Project Overview

  This project aims to predict customer churn in the telecom industry using Python, SQL, and Power BI. Customer churn refers to the phenomenon where customers stop using a companyâ€™s services within a specific period. For subscription-based businesses like telecom providers, understanding and predicting churn is critical, as retaining existing customers is generally more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. The project utilizes SQL for data handling, Python for data processing and modeling and Power BI to create an interactive dashboard that visualizes key insights and trends related to churn.
